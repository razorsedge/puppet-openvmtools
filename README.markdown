##Overview

This Puppet module manages the installation and configuration of the [Open Virtual Machine Tools](http://open-vm-tools.sourceforge.net/) for VMware.  VMware [recommends using open-vm-tools](http://kb.vmware.com/kb/2073803) redistributed by operating system vendors.

##Module Description

open-vm-tools is the open source implementation of VMware Tools and consists of a suite of virtualization utilities that improves the functionality, administration, and management of virtual machines within a VMware environment. The primary purpose for open-vm-tools is to enable operating system vendors and/or communities and virtual appliance vendors to bundle VMware Tools into their product releases.

The benefits of bundling open-vm-tools are:

* End users get the best out-of-box experience to efficiently deploy virtual machines on VMware virtual infrastructure.
* Eliminates the need to separately install VMware Tools when open-vm-tools is bundled with the operating system because open-vm-tools is a fully-supported open source implementation of VMware Tools.
* Reduces operational expenses and virtual machine downtime because updates to open-vm-tools packages are provided with operating system maintenance updates and patches. This eliminates separate maintenance cycles for VMware Tools updates.
* No compatibility matrix check is required for open-vm-tools. Adhering to the VMware Compatibility Matrix for the guest OS release is sufficient.
* open-vm-tools bundled with the operating system provides a compact footprint optimized for each OS release.

##Setup

###What this module affects

* Installs the main package open-vm-tools.
* Optionally installs the desktop package open-vm-tools-desktop.
* Starts the vmtoolsd daemon.

###Requirements

You need to be running a virtual machine on the VMware platform and on an operating system that ships the Open Virtual Machine Tools for this module to do anything.

###Beginning with this module

It is safe for all nodes to use this declaration.  Any non-VMware or unsupported system will skip installtion of the tools.
```puppet
include ::openvmtools
```

To include the desktop software, set the following parameter:
```puppet
class { '::openvmtools':
  with_desktop => true,
}
```

##Usage

There is only one class and most usage will simply include the `openvmtools` class.

##Reference

* openvmtools: Installs the Open Virtual Machine Tools.

###Parameters

####`ensure`

Ensure if present or absent.
Default: present

Default: auto-set, platform specific

####`service_ensure`

Ensure if service is running or stopped.
Default: running

####`service_name`

Name of openvmtools service.  Only set this if your platform is not supported or you know what you are doing.
Default: auto-set, platform specific

####`service_enable`

Start service at boot.
Default: true

####`service_hasstatus`

Service has status command.  Only set this if your platform is not supported or you know what you are doing.
Default: auto-set, platform specific

####`service_pattern`

Pattern to look for in the process table to determine if the daemon is running.  Only set this if your platform is not supported or you know what you are doing.
Default: vmtoolsd for Linux Disributives and vmware_guestd for FreeBSD

##Limitations

###OS Support:

open-vm-tools is available with these operating systems:

* Debian 7.x and later releases
* Recent Ubuntu releases (12.04 LTS, 13.10 and later)
* openSUSE 11.x and later releases
* SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 and later releases
* Fedora 19 and later releases
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.0 and later releases
* CentOS 7 
* Oracle Linux 7
* FreeBSD 10.0 10.1 10.2

###Notes:

* No other VM tools (ie [Operating System Specific Packages](http://packages.vmware.com/)) will be supported.  Use [razorsedge/vmwaretools](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/razorsedge/vmwaretools) instead.

###Issues:

* None
